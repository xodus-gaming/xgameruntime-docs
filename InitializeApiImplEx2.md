# InitializeApiImplEx2

```c
HRESULT WINAPI InitializeApiImpl(
    ULONG gdkVer,
    ULONG gsVer,
    char mode,
    const XGameRuntimeOptions *options
);
```

InitializeApiImplEx2 is called by both of the following functions:
- [XGameRuntimeInitialize](https://learn.microsoft.com/gaming/gdk/docs/reference/system/xgameruntimeinit/functions/xgameruntimeinitialize)
- [XGameRuntimeInitializeWithOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/gaming/gdk/docs/reference/system/xgameruntimeinit/functions/xgameruntimeinitializewithoptions)

`mode` appears to be a bitfield likely related to both the runtime version and `options` value.

`mode` flag values seen:
- `0x01` - Set when a method is queried when the runtime has not been initialized is in the same directory as the executable, in which case InitializeApiImplEx2 seems to be called for every method. It is also set when calling [XGameRuntimeInitializeWithOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/gaming/gdk/docs/reference/system/xgameruntimeinit/functions/xgameruntimeinitializewithoptions) with `gameConfigSource` set as [XGameRuntimeConfigSource::Default](https://learn.microsoft.com/xbox/gdk/docs/reference/system/xgameruntimeinit/enumerations/xgameruntimegameconfigsource).
- `0x02` - Unknown, always set.
- `0x08` - Set when `xgameruntime.dll` is in the same directory as the executable, as is required for GDK titles on the Steam Deck.
